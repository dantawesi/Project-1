Data Import and cleaning
-Imported csv files for SAT and ACT datasets for 2017 and 2018
- Checked for wrong variables and cleaned accordingly
Exploratory Data Analysis
- Run basic descriptives on data
- Answered the following questions: 
	Which states have the highest and lowest participation rates for the:
		2017 SAT?
		2018 SAT?
		2017 ACT?
		2018 ACT?
	Which states have the highest and lowest mean total/composite scores for the:
		2017 SAT?
		2018 SAT?
		2017 ACT?
		2018 ACT?
	Do any states with 100% participation on a given test have a rate change year-to-year?
	Do any states show have >50% participation on both tests either year?
Data Visualization
- Plotted various graphs to clearly illustrate the relationship between the variables
Descriptive and Inferential Statistics
- Used statistics to describe distributions and hypothesis testing.
Outside Research
- Talk about interesting findings in participation rate for 3 countries
